# pre-Registration

- All information in this document has to be frozen _before_ data
  analysis and _even better_, ideally, _before_ data collection;
- Any changes during the data collection and analysis process that
  would take place _after_ the pre-registration date _must_ be stated
  in a separate document with reference to planned processes described
  in this document;


1 Research questions / statements
---

- Describe the general aims of the study as well as potential specific
  research questions / statements.

```


```

  
2 Variables
---

- Describe the variables that will be recorded during the data
  collection phase;
- Provide informations concerning variable transformation when needed;
- Describe levels when applicable as well as variable scales;
- Dissociate dependent vs. independent variables if applicable;
- Identify control / secondary independent variables;
- Describe relations between IVs;

```


```

2.1 Dependent Variables / Responses
---

```


```

2.2 Independant Variables / Predictors
---

```


```

3 Methods and data collection principles
---

- Describe the specific methods for data collection;
- Describe data manipulation planification;
- Describe instructions that will be given to the participants;

```


```

4 Hypotheses
---

- When several hypotheses will be investigated, they should be
  numbered;
- Distinguish between general / theoretical hypotheses and operational
  ones (these will necessarily be articulated with the described
  variables). They should use the same numbering scheme;

```

4.1 General hypotheses

```


```

4.2 Operational hypotheses
---

```


```

5 Sampling procedure
---

- Describe criteria for participants selection;
- Describe planned sample size (number of participants, number of
  measurements per participant...);
- Describe criteria for data collection termination rules. If there is
  no criterium, indicate planning for how many participants will be
  recruited;
- Describe anticipated principles and procedures for missing data and
  or outlier identification / exclusion / replacement if applicable;
- Describe criteria for participants exclusion;
- Set criteria of exclusion in order to state conditions that would
  require the whole experiment to be stopped, re-run and / or
  re-designed;

```


```

6 Results analyses
---

- Describe planned data analyses (correlations between variables,
  grouped comparisons) specifying which variables will be
  investigated;
- Describe which statistical tools / methods will be applied;
- Describe assumptions associated with the statistical tools and plans
  in case these assumptions were not met;

Statement concerning the situation with respect to the relation
between pre-registration and data collection / analyses (identify the
current situation and describe when appropriate).

__Case 1__ Data collection has not begun yet; 

__Case 2__ Data collection has begun but the results have not been
	explored yet. Provide indications concerning data collection
	advancement and what kind of results have been explored if any.

__Case 3__ Data collection has begun and the results have been partially
	explored. Provide indications concerning data collection
	advancement and what kind of results have been explored at the
	time of pre-registration.

__Case 4__ Data collection is completed. Provide indications concerning
	what kind of results have been explored at the time of
	pre-registration.
